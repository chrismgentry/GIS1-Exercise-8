This exercise will introduce digital elevation models, downloading data from a [Federal Emergency Management Agency](https://www.fema.gov/) ArcGIS Viewer, and create derive topographic datasets.

# The Introduction

Middle Tennessee has a history of [significant weather events](https://www.weather.gov/ohx/calendar) including more than two dozen major flooding events over the past 100yrs. Several precipitation events over the past decade have caused devastating flooding in Cheatman, Davidson, Humphreys, and Montgomery counties. These floods alone cost Tennessee more than $2.5 billion dollars and resulted in the loss of more than 50 lives. 

A recent analysis of the historic 2019 floods in the midwest estimated more than 1.1 million acres of agricultural fields were flooded costing the US more than $3 billion dollars. This combined with the most recent economic outlook for rural communities in the 4th National Climate Assessment [report](https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/19#key-message-4) suggest an increase in economic vulnerabilities in the agricultural sectors of the Southeast. Based on your recent work for FEMA ([Exercise 4](https://chrismgentry.github.io/GIS1-Exercise-4/)) and MCEMA ([Exercise 2](https://chrismgentry.github.io/GIS1-Exercise-2/)), they recommended that the [Tennessee Emergency Management Agency](https://www.tn.gov/tema.html) and [Tennessee Department of Agriculture](https://www.tn.gov/agriculture.html) hire you to help analyze the impact of flooding on croplands in Montgomery County.

In this exercise you will:

-   Download hazard data from FEMA
-   Develop topographically derived datasets from raster data
-   Calculate geometric extend of vector data
-   Create graphs of attribute information

Software specific directions can be found for each step below. Please submit the answer to the questions and your final map by the due date.

## Step One: The Data

The data you will be using for this exercise comes from the [FEMA National Flood Hazard Layer digital viewer](https://hazards-fema.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=8b0adb51996444d4879338b5529aa9cd) and is compiled from various sources including the Flood Rate Insurance Map (FIRM) which is the source of some flood-related definitions in this exercise.

<details>
<summary><big>View Directions in <b> [ArcGIS Pro]{style="color:#ff4500"} </b></big></summary>

To begin, open a new browser window/tab and go to the [FEMA NFHL digital viewer](https://hazards-fema.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=8b0adb51996444d4879338b5529aa9cd). On the welcome page you will be greeted with a warning window. Click OK and then zoom into campus.

<p align="center"><div class="zoom"><img src= "Images/fema-nfhl-homepage.png" alt="NFHL Homepage" style="width:100%"></div></p>

When you are able to see campus at the same zoom level as in the image below, click on the image and you will see a pop-up box with options to download the information

<p align="center"><div class="zoom"><img src= "Images/fema-nfhl-download.png" alt="NFHL Download" style="width:100%"></div></p>

Click on the <b><u>Download</u> county GIS data</b> link and save the file in your project folder for this exercise. Unzip the compressed folder and view the information within the _Catalog Pane_. You should now see a number of possible shapefiles in the unzipped folder. The one you need to add to your map is **S_FLD_HAZ_AR.shp**.

<p align="center"><img src= "Images/arcgis-flood-hazard-data.jpg" alt="Hazard Data in Catalog Pane" style="width:70%"></p>

Examining the attribute table for the dataset you will see a number of different variables; some of them without data or with a value of -9999 which is used by a number of different data formats to mean no data. The two variables you will use for this exercise is the **FLD_ZONE** and **ZONE_SUBTY**. Notice that the FLD_ZONE field is populated with "X", "A", and "AE" values while the ZONE_SUBTY has three values "0.2 PCT Annual Chance Flood Hazard", "Area of Minimal Flood Hazard", and "Floodway". The following is a brief description of each:

- **A**: a high-risk flood zone that has a one percent chance of flooding each year. Over the course of a 30-year mortgage, the likelihood of a flood is 26 percent. There are no detailed analyses of areas in Flood Zone A, so there are no depths or base flood elevations in this zone.
- **AE**: a high-risk flood zone that present a one percent annual chance of flooding and a 26% chance over the life of a 30-year mortgage. These regions are clearly defined in Flood Insurance Rate Maps and are paired with detailed information about base flood elevations.
- **X**: area determined to be outside the 500-year flood and protected by levee from 100- year flood.
- **0.2 PCT Annual Chance Flood Hazard**: area with a moderate chance of flood equal to 0.2 percent annually. 
- **Area of Minimal Flood Hazard**: area determined to be outside the 500-year flood and protected by levee from 100- year flood.
- **Floodway**: the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height.

For this analysis you will focus on A, AE, and 0.2 PCT Annual Chance Flood Hazard zones. While there are a number of ways to subset the data, in this exercise you will simply right-click on the dataset and select _Data > Export Features_. In the resulting window select the flood hazard data as the Input Feature, use the browse button to select the output location in your project folder, and give the \*.shp file a new name. Next, click the new expression button and use the following SQL:

`Where FLD_ZONE is equal to A`

Then click Add Clause...

`Or Where FLD_ZONE is equal to AE`

Then click Add Clause...

`Or Where ZONE_SUBTY is equal to 0.2 PCT Annual Chance Flood Hazard`

And finally click OK. This will create a new dataset that includes only the selected variables.

<p align="center"><div class="zoom"><img src= "Images/arcgis-flood-zone-expression.png" alt="Selecting only the flood zone information from above" style="width:100%"></div></p>

Next, open a new tab in your browser to download the remaining data for this exercise from the exercise [**GitHub Page**](https://github.com/chrismgentry/GIS1-Exercise-8/tree/main/Data "Click Here"). The **montco_dem_feet.tif** is the digital elevation model that will be used to calculate contours and the **montco_crop_land** zip contains a shapefile of selected cropland data for Montgomery County from the _USDA National Agriculture Statistics Service_ [CropScape](https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/) Website. With this data downloaded to your project folder, add them to your map view. On the example below the names and symbology for the flood zones were changed to reflect their category description.

- **Floodway**: the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height.

For this analysis you will focus on A, AE, and 0.2 PCT Annual Chance Flood Hazard zones. In order to isolate those specific values you will click the _Select features using an expression_ button <img src= "Images/qgis-attribute-expression-button.jpg" alt="Select by Expression" width="20" height="20"> from the _S_FLD_HAZ_AR_ attribute table and use the following expression:

```
 "FLD_ZONE" = 'A' or  "FLD_ZONE" = 'AE' or  "ZONE_SUBTY" = '0.2 PCT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD HAZARD' 
```

To input the expression, expand the "Fields and Values" attributes, double-click on the _FLD_ZONE_ field and type **=**. Next, click the "All Unique Values" button in the _Values_ section of the window. This will show all options available under that field. Double-click on **A**. Now type **or** in the expression to add an or statement; meaning that you want to select a value of this _or_ this. Repeat the steps by adding the AE value from FLD_ZONE and finally adding the 0.2 PCT Annual Chance Flood Hazard from the ZONE_SUBTY. When your expression is complete, click the _Select Features_ button in the bottom right corner of the window. This will select all of the data that meets your criteria. Finally, using the same procedure as in [Exercise 4, Step 1](https://chrismgentry.github.io/GIS1-Exercise-4/#11_Step_One:_The_Data), right/CRTL click on the _S_FLD_HAZ_AR_ and select _Export > Save Selected Features As..._ to create a new dataset that includes only the selected values.

<p align="center"><div class="zoom"><img src= "Images/qgis-flood-zone-expression.png" alt="Selecting only the flood zone information from above" style="width:100%"></div></p>

Next, open a new tab in your browser to download the remaining data for this exercise from the exercise [**GitHub Page**](https://github.com/chrismgentry/GIS1-Exercise-8/tree/main/Data "Click Here"). The **montco_dem_feet.tif** is the digital elevation model that will be used to calculate contours and the **montco_crop_land** zip contains a shapefile of selected cropland data for Montgomery County from the _USDA National Agriculture Statistics Service_ [CropScape](https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/) Website. With this data downloaded to your project folder, add them to your map view. On the example below the names and symbology for the flood zones were changed to reflect their category description. This was accomplished through the symbology tab, selecting categorize, and writing an expression in the _Value_ field for _FLD_ZONE_ + _ZONE_SUBTY_  or by first selecting _FLD_ZONE_ and classifying that information and then changing the value to _ZONE_SUBTY_ and clicking **NO** when the "Delete Classification" warning pops-up and then classifying the new selection. Just be sure to use the <b>[-]{style="color: #FF0000"}</b> to remove any value that was not included in the expression above.

Before you begin, you will need to open the [Ex2 Colab Notebook](https://github.com/chrismgentry/GIS1-Exercise-8/blob/main/GIS1_EX8.ipynb) and insert **tocolab** after _github_ in the URL to open in the _Colab Environment_. As you have seen before, R requires various packages to complete certain analyses. In this exercise you will be using **tidyverse, OpenStreetMaps, ggfortify, maptools, and rgeos**. To install and load the packages we will use the following script:

Blah...blah...blah...

<big><b>Question No. 1</b></big>

</details>

## Step Two: The Analyses

In order to determine the elevations that are most susceptible to flooding you will need to create contours from the DEM. 

<details>
<summary><big>View Directions in <b> [ArcGIS Pro]{style="color:#ff4500"} </b></big></summary>

By either searching through the tools drop-down menu or by searching for it in the Geoprocessing Tools, open the `Contour` tool, provide the following parameters, and click Run:

- Input raster = montco_dem_feet.tif
- Output feature class = navigate to your project folder and save as a shapefile (\*.shp)
- Countour interval = 20
- Base contour = 100
- Z factor = 1
- Contour type = Contour
- Maximum verticies per feature = leave blank

<p align="center"><div class="zoom"><img src= "Images/arcgis-create-contours.png" alt="Create Contours" style="width:100%"></div></p>

You will now have contours added to your map view. The contours will encompass the entire county because they were created from the county DEM.

<p align="center"><div class="zoom"><img src= "Images/arcgis-contours.png" alt="Contours" style="width:100%"></div></p>

While this information could be beneficial for other analyses, for this exercise you should **clip** the contours based on the flood zone dataset you created in [Step 1](https://chrismgentry.github.io/GIS1-Exercise-8/#11_Step_One:_The_Data). This will create a new dataset that includes only the elevations prone to flooding issues.

<p align="center"><div class="zoom"><img src= "Images/arcgis-all-data-step2.png" alt="Data Example" style="width:100%"></div></p>

Finally, because this exercise focuses on croplands that are susceptible to flooding, **clip** the cropland dataset to the selected flood zones layer as well. Then you can use the symbology tool to give the data _unique values_ by _class_name_.

<big><b>Question No. 2</b></big>
<blockquote>
_What is the range of elevations in flood prone areas?_
</blockquote>

</details>
<hr></hr>

<details>
<summary><big>View Directions in <b> [QGIS]{style="color:#006400"} </b></big></summary>

Navigate to _Raster > Extraction > Contour..._ on the Menu Bar and in the resulting window input the following parameters and click Run:

- Input layer = montoco_dem_feet.tif
- Band number = Band 1: Band_1 (Gray)
- Interval between contour lines = 20
- Attribute name = ELEV
- Offset from zero relative to which to interpret intervals = 100
- Contours = You can create a temporary file or save it as a permanent shapefile file in your project folder.

<p align="center"><div class="zoom"><img src= "Images/qgis-create-contours.png" alt="Create Contours" style="width:100%"></div></p>

You will now have contours added to your map view. The contours will encompass the entire county because they were created from the county DEM.

<p align="center"><div class="zoom"><img src= "Images/qgis-contours.png" alt="Contours" style="width:100%"></div></p>

While this information could be beneficial for other analyses, for this exercise you should **clip** the contours based on the flood zone dataset you created in [Step 1](https://chrismgentry.github.io/GIS1-Exercise-8/#11_Step_One:_The_Data). This will create a new dataset that includes only the elevations prone to flooding issues.

<p align="center"><div class="zoom"><img src= "Images/qgis-all-data-step2.png" alt="Data Example" style="width:100%"></div></p>

Finally, because this exercise focuses on croplands that are susceptible to flooding, **clip** the cropland dataset to the selected flood zones layer as well. Then you can give the data _categorized_ symbology by _class_name_.

</details>

## Step Three: The Visualization

In this step you will create landscape views that mimic three dimensional surfaces and provide a custom color palette for the croplands based on data from the State of Tennessee, Department of Agriculture.

<details><summary><big>View directions in <b> [ArcGIS Pro]{style="color:#ff4500"} </b></span></big></summary>

While there are a number of possible color palettes that could be used to display the crop information, the Department of Agriculture provides a [suggested color palette](https://github.com/chrismgentry/GIS1-Exercise-8/blob/main/Data/crop_legend_TN_2020.jpg "Open in New Tab") to be used for mapping croplands in Tennessee. 

With the symbology pane open for the flood prone croplands (which should be in unique values), click on the color box for the first record. This will open the _Format Polygon Symbol_ for the record where you can change the **color properties** for the symbol by clicking on the drop-down menu and clicking color properies. In the _Color Editor_ menu you can type in the HEX# value provided on the palette image and click OK. Then apply the changes. 

<p align="center"><div class="zoom"><img src= "Images/arcgis-color-editor.png" alt="Input Hex Value Colors" style="width:100%"></div></p>

Repeat these steps for each of the values in the dataset based on the HEX values provided on the image. When complete, click _More_ and uncheck the box to "Show All Other Values". This will remove the "all other values" category from your dataset symbology.

<p align="center"><img src= "Images/arcgis-remove-all-other.jpg" alt="Remove All Other Values" style="width:60%"></p>

Next, you will use a technique called **hillshade** which creates a ["grayscale 3D representation of the terrain surface for qualitative visualization of topography."](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/raster-functions/hillshade-function.htm) Because the function produces a qualitative view it does not give absolute elevation values. However, you can use it in conjunction with other layers to provide enhanced, custom views of terrain. On the _Analysis Tab_ click the button for **Raster Functions**. In the Raster Functions pane, use the drop-down menu next to "Surface" and click _Hillshade_. In the _Hillshade Properties_ menu parameters select the following options and click "Create new layer":

- Raster = montco_dem_feet
- Hillshade Type = Multidirectional
- Scaling = None
- Z Factor = 1

<p align="center"><div class="zoom"><img src= "Images/arcgis-hillshade.png" alt="Hillshade" style="width:100%"></div></p>

With the hillshade created, reorder the layers in your table of content to place the hillshade layer below the DEM. In the symbology options (Raster Layer > Appearance) for the DEM, select an appropriate color scheme and make the DEM layer slightly transparent (play around with varying percentages) to provide a three-dimensional look to Montgomery County.

<p align="center"><div class="zoom"><img src= "Images/arcgis-3D-topography.png" alt="DEM over Hillshade" style="width:100%"></div></p>

Now finalize your map by customizing the various layers to provide the optimal visualization of the data and adding all of the necessary elements.

<big><b>Question No. 3</b></big>
<blockquote>
_What were the range of values provided for the hillshade image and what do you think the values represent?_
</blockquote>

While there are a number of possible color palettes that could be used to display the crop information, the Department of Agriculture provides a [suggested color palette](https://github.com/chrismgentry/GIS1-Exercise-8/blob/main/Data/crop_legend_TN_2020.jpg "Open in New Tab") to be used for mapping croplands in Tennessee. 

Open the Layer Properties - Symbology window for the crop lands. Next double-click on the symbol for the first record. In the _symbol selector_ window click on the color to open the _select color_ window. In the _HTML notation_ selector, type in the corresponding value from the color palette above. Click OK on the select color and symbol selector windows and _Apply_ on the symbology window. 

<p align="center"><div class="zoom"><img src= "Images/qgis-color-editor.png" alt="Input Hex Value Colors" style="width:100%"></div></p>

Repeat these steps for each of the values in the dataset based on the HTML values provided on the image. When complete, be sure to remove the "all other values" category.

Next, you will use a technique called **hillshade** which creates a ["grayscale 3D representation of the terrain surface for qualitative visualization of topography."](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/raster-functions/hillshade-function.htm) Because the function produces a qualitative view it does not give absolute elevation values. However, you can use it in conjunction with other layers to provide enhanced, custom views of terrain. In the Geoprocessing Toolbox search for **Hillshade**. Select the option under _Raster terrain analysis > Hillshade_. In the new window choose the following parameters and click Run:

- Elevation layer = montco_dem_feet
- Z Factor = 1
- Azimuth = 180
- Vertical angle = 70
- Hillshade = You can create a temporary file or save it as a permanent tif file in your project folder.

<p align="center"><div class="zoom"><img src= "Images/qgis-hillshade-options.png" alt="Hillshade Options" style="width:100%"></div></p>

With the hillshade created, reorder the layers to place the hillshade layer below the DEM. In the symbology options for the DEM, change the "Render Type" to **Singleband pseudocolor", select an appropriate color ramp and besure it is classified in the display. 

<p align="center"><div class="zoom"><img src= "Images/qgis-raster-symbology.png" alt="Raster Symbology Options" style="width:100%"></div></p>

Make the DEM layer slightly transparent (play around with varying percentages) and click OK to provide a three-dimensional look to Montgomery County.

<p align="center"><div class="zoom"><img src= "Images/qgis-3D-topography.png" alt="DEM over Hillshade" style="width:100%"></div></p>

Now finalize your map by customizing the various layers and base layers to provide the optimal visualization of the data and adding all of the necessary elements.

## Step Four: The Damage

In order to visualize the potential impact of flooding on croplands and determine which crops are most susceptible you will need to create a graph of the information.

<details><summary><big>View directions in <b> [ArcGIS Pro]{style="color:#ff4500"} </b></span></big></summary>

Right-click on the flood prone cropland dataset and go to _Create Chart > Bar Chart_. On the chart properties pane select _class_name_ as the Category, no aggregation, and add _area_ as the numeric field. To make the chart more presentable, sort the values by descending order on the Y-axis and navigate through the various options (series, axes, guides, format, general) and make any necessary changes to the graph. Keep in mind that the area values in the attribute table/chart are in square feet. To convert this information to acres divide the area values (in ft^2^) by 43,560.

<p align="center"><div class="zoom"><img src= "Images/arcgis-cropland-chart.png" alt="Creating Chart of Data" style="width:100%"></div></p>

In [Exercise 5, Step 4](https://chrismgentry.github.io/GIS1-Exercise-5/#14_Step_Four:_The_County_Commisson_Report) you went to _Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins_ on the Menu Bar and installed the Bivariate Legend plugin. Return to your QGIS map view (not the layout view) and repeat those same steps to install the **Data Plotly** plugin. This will add a _DataPlotly_ button <img src= "Images/qgis-data-plotly-button.jpg" alt="Shows the DataPlotly dock" width="20" height="20"> to your toolbar that opens a new pane to the right of the screen.

Click on the _DataPlotly_ button and use the following parameters then click Create Plot:

- Plot type = Bar Plot
- Layer = The dataset you created that is only the croplands within the flood prone areas
- X field = Class_Name
- Y field = Area
- Bar color = Your choice
- Strok color = Your choice
- Opacity = Your choice
- Label text position = Automatic
- Bar orientation = Vertical

<p align="center"><div class="zoom"><img src= "Images/qgis-data-plotly.png" alt="DataPlotly Dock" style="width:100%"></div></p>

A new plot will appear once create plot is pressed. You can return to the DataPlotly home dock by pressing the dock button <img src= "Images/qgis-dataplotly-dock-button.jpg" alt="Shows the DataPlotly dock" width="20" height="20">, you can customize the chart using the configuration button <img src= "Images/qgis-dataplotly-configuration-button.jpg" alt="Configure DataPlotly" width="20" height="20">, view the chart with the chart button <img src= "Images/qgis-dataplotly-chart-button.jpg" alt="Display Chart" width="20" height="20"> and on the chart screen export the chart using the export button <img src= "Images/qgis-dataplotly-export-button.jpg" alt="Export chart" width="20" height="20"> in the bottom right corner of the chart window.
